# ClientServerGuessingGame
I created a server program to accept connections from clients (game players); receive guesses from the clients (players) and respond suitably; stop the game if the client (player) guesses correctly, or if they run out of time. Meanwhile, the client program interacts with both the server and the player of the game.
